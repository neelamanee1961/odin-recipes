    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>2 cups "Kekulu" Rice (Substitute : Basmati, Jasmine)</li>
    <li>3 3/4 cups Water </li>
    <li>400 milliliters Thick coconut milk ( 400ml = 1 2/3 cups = 1 can) </li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Salt </li></ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
<li>Wash your rice first, then drain water and put it into the rice cooker or instant pot (which is what I use here) or any pot you cook your rice usually.</li>
<li>Add water and 1 tsp salt (keep rest of the salt for after). Cook your rice using your usual method. If you're using a rice cooker, turn on the cook switch. If you're using an instant pot, press the rice preset. All you do here is cook rice the normal way but with just a little bit of water than you’d normally use.
</li>
<li>Get your thick coconut milk (I use one 400ml can for 2 cups of rice) and the rest of the salt to it and dissolve well. Taste it and it should taste a little salty. If you have tasted Kiribath before your coconut milk should have a similar taste to Kiribath now. Adjust salt to your liking. 
</li>
<li>Add the coconut milk to the cooked rice as soon as the rice is done cooking. Do NOT wait until the rice cools down.
</li>
<li>Mix your rice and coconut milk very well using a spoon until the rice grains breakdown and everything sticks together. You can transfer the rice to a banana leaf or a tray at this point and shape it. But if you still get the raw coconut milk smell, turn on the heat back again and cook for about 2- 3 more minutes on the stove or in the rice cooker. If you’re using an instant pot, press the “Keep warm” option and leave it covered for about 5 - 8 mins
</li>
</ol>
